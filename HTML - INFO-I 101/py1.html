		<h2>First Day of Learning Python</h2>

		<h3>Name and define the programming terms we learned today and why is it important to keep track of data types?</h3>
		<p>Today was the first day of learning the (first) programming language <b>Python</b>. The list of functions we learnt today were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Print - Number and String</li>
			<li>Math Operations (+, -, *, /)</li>
			<li>Defining variables and computing them</li>
			<li>Data types - Integers, String, Float/Decimals</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The <b>Print</b> function can be used to print any kind of data types, strings, integers and floats. The print statements can also used to compute simple math operations and directly print them, some thing <i>print(5 + 6)</i>. <br/> 
		For <b>Math Operations</b> we learnt the basic math operations - adding, subtacting, multiply, and divide - to compute diffirent numbers. Simple examples of them would be <i>"5+7"</i> or <i>30%9</i>. 
		Moreover, we also learnt how to add 2 strings and "concatinate" them together if we want to print them.<br/>
		Next we learnt how to <b>Define Variables</b>. We use them to define a variable to be a string or a integer or any other datatype. An exmaple would be <i>x = 5*8</i> or <i>word = "Hello World"</i>.
		We also learnt about the fact that when we are computing and 2 variables, they have to be of the same <b>Data Type</b> or similar. This is called <b>Data Integrety</b>. For exmaples the function, <i>print(x + word)</i> would give us an error because we are trying to add a string and integer.<br/>
		However, we can compute them if we make the variable <i>"x"</i> a string and then concatinate them. For example <i>print(str(x) + word)</i> and that would give us the output as <i>"40Hello World"</i>. This is why it is really important to keep track of the data types because you cant compute all kinds of data types with each other.
		<br/>We can also convert string to integers. For example <i>print(str("6") + 6)</i> which would give the output as <i>12</i>.</p>
