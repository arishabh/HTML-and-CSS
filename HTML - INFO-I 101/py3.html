				<li>What is the correct syntax for a while loop?</li>
				<li>What is a good use of remove in a program?</li>
			</ol>
		</h3>
		<p>So the right syntax of the whole loop is <i>while ():</i>. Here the argument in the parenthisis will have the condition. The loop will be continuously running again and agin
		untill the condition is true. If you want an infinite loop, you can put, <i>while True:</i>. The semicolon(:) is important orelse any loop wont run.</p>
		<p>The remove program can be used to remove anything from a list, like if you want do shopping, you can remove items from the list until the list is empty</p>
